Javascript error stack trace
An error stack trace tells a developer that it has detected 
an error within the code. Along with, which line to find the error, 
what type of error has occurred and a description of the error.

This information is logged as an error stack trace â€” a printed message containing information 
about where the error occurred, what type of error was thrown, and a description of the error.
