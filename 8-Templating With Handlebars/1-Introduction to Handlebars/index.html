/* what is ahndlebars??
1) Handlebars is an external library used to create templates which are a mix of HTML, text, and expressions. */
2) Handlebars uses expressions which are wrapped inside double braces like: {{someVariable}}
3) A script tag with a type of "text/x-handlebars-template" is used to deliver a template to the browser.
4) Handlebar.compile() returns a templating function from a template script intended for Handlebars.
5) A template created from .compile() will take an object as an argument and use it as context to generate a string containing HTML.
6) Handlebars has built in block helpers which can be included in a Handlebars script.
7) Block helpers have a starting expression and an ending expression. The starting expression will have a # appears before a keyword. The ending expression will have the same keyword but with a / character to denote the end.
8) The {{if}} will conditionally render a block of code.
9) An {{else}} expression can be inserted into an if helper block and used as part of the conditional statement.
10) {{each}} is another built-in helper expression which accepts an an array to iterate through.
11) In the block helper functions, the {{this}} expression gives context and serves as a placeholder for the current value. */

      <p>
        It is without a doubt that {{flavor}} is the best ice cream flavor in the world. If it was left to me, I would have {{flavor}} ice cream all year round. The next time I get ice cream, I will be getting {{flavor}} because why get something else when when you can get the best.
