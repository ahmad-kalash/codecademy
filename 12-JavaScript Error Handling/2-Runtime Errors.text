Runtime Errors
Errors contain useful messages that tell us why our program isnâ€™t working or why the error was 
thrown. When an error is thrown, our program stops running and the console displays the error 
message in red text


When we execute code and a line of code throws an error, that error is referred to as a runtime error. 
In JavaScript, there are built-in error objects that have a name and message property which 
tell us what went wrong. Examples of built-in runtime errors include:

-ReferenceError: when a variable or function cannot be found.
-TypeError: when a value is not a valid type, see the example below:
