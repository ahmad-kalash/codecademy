The throw Keyword

Creating an error doesn’t cause our program to stop — remember, an error must be thrown for it to 
halt the program.

To throw an error in JavaScript, we use the throw keyword like so:

throw Error('Something wrong happened');
// Error: Something wrong happened


When we use the throw keyword, the error is thrown and code after throw statement will not execute.
