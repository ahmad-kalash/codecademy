In this lesson, we will explain how to use fetch(), which uses promises to handle requests. Then, we will simplify requests using async and await.

We’ll use the Datamuse API for GET requests and Rebrandly URL Shortener API for POST requests. 


fetch() GET Requests I
The first type of requests we’re going to tackle are GET requests using fetch()

MDN: Fetch API.
The fetch() function:

1) Creates a request object that contains relevant information that an API needs.
2) Sends that request object to the API endpoint provided.
3) Returns a promise that ultimately resolves to a response object, which contains the status of the promise with information the API sent back.

In the next exercise we’ll go over the boilerplate code for using fetch() and walk through what each step does!
